# Supported Compilers

Following compilers are backed up by the GitHub Action [workflows](https://github.com/silverqx/TinyORM/tree/main/.github/workflows) (CI pipelines), these workflows also include more then __3269 unit tests__ ðŸ˜®ðŸ’¥.

<div id="supported-compilers">

#### `Windows >=10` {#windows-10}

- MSVC 2019 `>=16.9`
- MSVC 2022 `>=17`
- MSYS2 UCRT64 GCC `10.2` - `12.2`
- MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang `>=15`
- clang-cl `>=15` with MSVC 2019/2022

#### `Linux`

- GCC `10.2` - `12.2`
- Clang `>=15` <small className='darker'>(libstdc++ only)</small>

</div>

:::tip
You can compile TinyORM with the MSVC 2022 even if Qt doesn't provide binaries for the MSVC 2022, you can link against Qt MSVC 2019 binaries without any limitations.

:::caution
The `macOS` and Clang with `libc++` are not supported.

## Supported build systems

- `CMake` `>=3.22` <small className='darker'>(policies <= CMP0128 default to NEW)</small>
- `qmake` distributed by the Qt Framework

##### Make tools

- `jom` - highly recommended with the `qmake` build system on Windows <small className='darker'>(replacement for nmake)</small>
- `ninja` - recommended for `CMake` as the make file generator

##### Parallel building

You can control parallel building using the following environment variables.

- CMake - `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` eg. to `10`
- jom - `JOMFLAGS` eg. to `j11`
- make - `MAKEFLAGS` eg. to `-j10`
- vcpkg - `VCPKG_MAX_CONCURRENCY` eg. to `10`
