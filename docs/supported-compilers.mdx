# Supported Compilers

Following compilers are backed up by the GitHub Action [workflows](https://github.com/silverqx/TinyORM/tree/main/.github/workflows) (CI pipelines), these workflows also include more then 975 unit tests ðŸ˜®.

Windows >=10:

- MSVC 2019 16.9 - 16.11.15
- MSYS2 UCRT64 GCC 10.2 - 11.3
- MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang 12 - 14

Linux:

- GCC 10.2 - 11.3
- Clang 11 - 14

:::caution
The MSVC >=17 (Visual Studio 2022) is not supported as the Qt Framework doesn't support it and it looks like the currently upcoming Qt 6.4.0 will not have the MSVC 17 support ðŸ˜ž, support will be added immediately after the Qt adds this support.
