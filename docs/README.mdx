# Prologue

TinyORM is a modern c++ ORM library that makes interacting with a database extremely simple. It depends on the `QtCore` and `QtSql` libraries.

The code is written in the modern c++20 way and is well tested with the unit and functional tests. Almost all the query builder methods are unit tested. The TinyORM's query builder code and the code which is responsible for obtaining relationships, is tested by functional tests against all supported databases. The code coverage is good enough to guarantee API and behavior compatibility.

:::info
If you don't want to use full [`ORM`](tinyorm/getting-started.mdx), then you can use only the [`Query Builder`](database/query-builder.mdx), which is outstanding. ðŸ”¥ This way you can avoid writing raw SQL queries and your code will run on all [supported databases](database/getting-started.mdx#introduction).
