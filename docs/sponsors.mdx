# Sponsors

I have spent ~2 years every day 10 hours of coding (excluding weekends and sick days) to make this project real. Everything was funded from my personal resources, I had no problem with it to be honest, it was really fun üéâ, but I had to move to the new apartment a few months ago and I'm out of money now. ‚òπÔ∏è

I would like to continue developing and enhancing this project and I will as long as I can. But the future is unclear now.
