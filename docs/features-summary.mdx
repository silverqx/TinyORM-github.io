## Summary List

The following list fastly summarizes all the `TinyORM` features.

- __simple database connections management__ 🧬
  - database manager that helps with the database connections management
  - `Orm::DB` facade class for nicer and shorter syntax
  - MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL support for all features
  - multi-threading support 👀
- __impressive query builder__ 🔧
  - allows passing sub-queries and raw expressions practically everywhere, to column names, values, and to every SQL clause as select, where, joins, group by, having, order by 🔥
  - a logical grouping that offers to wrap logical groups in parenthesis
  - chunked results for lower memory footprint ✨
  - raw methods for all SQL clauses
  - all join types (left, right, cross, inner) and also join where clause support 🫤
  - aggregate methods min, max, sum, increment, decrement, ...
  - whereExists and exists methods for an existence queries
  - transactions and pessimistic locking 🔒
  - of course, insert, update, and delete SQL clauses support
  - __correct QDateTime time zone__ using the `qt_timezone` connection configuration option 📅 (returned QDateTime instances will have the correct time zone, and also works for an ORM)
    - this feature allows you to set up the database server time zone to the UTC and all returned QDateTime instances will have the correct UTC time zone
- __clever ORM with all relation types support__ 🎉
  - one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relation types (also inverse relationships)
  - eager and lazy loading with custom select and constraints 🚀
  - all query builder methods are proxied from the model instances and also from the relation instances back to the query builder 🤯 (everything that can be called on the query builder can also be called on the model and relation instances)
  - clean active record pattern
  - advanced features like timestamps, touching parent timestamps, __soft deleting__, default models, default model attributes, and attribute casting
  - querying relationships existence/absence using the has, whereHas, and hasNested methods (using dot notation for selecting nested relationships _users.posts.comments_)
- __compiled database migrations and seeders__ 🕺
  - create, update, drop, and rename database tables
  - create, drop, and rename table columns
  - extensive schema builder that allows creating of all possible column types
  - terser syntax for creating foreign keys and foreign key constraints
  - supports creating, and dropping column indexes (primary, unique, fulltext, spatial)
- __the `tom` console application with tab completion for all shells (pwsh, bash, zsh)__ 🥳
  - scaffolding of models, migrations, and seeders
  - impressive models scaffolding, every feature that is supported by models can be generated using the `tom make:model` cli command
- a huge amount of code is unit tested, currently __2096 unit tests__ 🤯
- C++20 only, with all the latest features used like concepts/constraints, ranges, smart pointers (no `new` keyword in the whole code 😎), folding expressions
- qmake and CMake build systems support
  - CMake FetchContent module support 🤙
- vcpkg support (also the vcpkg port, currently not committed to the vcpkg repository ☹️)
- it's really fast, you can run 1000 complex queries in 500ms (heavily DB dependant, the PostgreSQL is by far the fastest) ⌚
- extensive documentation 📃
- ...
