# TinyORM

TinyORM is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using TinyORM, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, TinyORM models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.
